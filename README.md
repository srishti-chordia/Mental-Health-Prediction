# Mental-Health-Prediction

Created a mental health prediction model to evaluate people's well-being from their past anxiety, depression, working hours, 
work environment, and relationships with supervisors and subordinates. Trained on the AdaBoost classifier with an 
accuracy of 87%. This project uses machine learning for behavioral analysis to offer data-driven insights for early 
intervention.
